# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-With-RTextTools
#Machine learning makes sentiment analysis more convenient. This post would introduce how to do sentiment analysis with machine learning #using R. In the landscape of R, the sentiment R package and the more general text mining package have been well developed by Timothy P. #Jurka. You can check out the sentiment package and the fantastic RTextTools package. Actually, Timothy also writes an maxent package for #low-memory multinomial logistic regression (also known as maximum entropy).

#However, the naive bayes method is not included into RTextTools. The e1071 package did a good job of implementing the naive bayes method. #e1071 is a course of the Department of Statistics (e1071), TU Wien. Its primary developer is David Meyer.

#The data comes from victorneo. victorneo shows how to do sentiment analysis for tweets using Python. Here, I will demonstrate how to do #it in R.
